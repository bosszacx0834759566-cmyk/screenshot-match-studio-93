- Reference downloaded video through a current-project Lovable Assets pointer, shared by the homepage and menu, so both play the same source reliably.
- Keep all published photos and clips in current-project Lovable Assets and preserve referenced assets; temporary files and other projects' assets are not reliable deployment sources.

- Media (video/photos) must be stored as current-project Lovable Assets pointers in src/assets/*.asset.json; never delete or replace them, never point at another project's assets. Why: other projects' or temp files vanish after publish. Guarded by src/test/media-assets.test.ts.

- Founder birth data (date, age calculation, Thai/English labels) lives in src/founder.ts and is rendered from there; never duplicate it inline in routes. Why: one source keeps the page, the SEO schema, and src/test/founder-age.test.ts in step.

- Decorative section keywords and codes use the shared EditorialStrip presentation with semantic colors and wrapping styles; why: annotations stay consistent across dark/light sections and small screens without changing factual content.

- Original imported media pointers are archived in place and must not be rendered; use the restored current-project pointers for all live media. Why: imported pointers are scoped to the source project and fail on this site's origin.
